# Noarch distribution adoption

## What

Adopt the suite distribution contract under uibcdf/molsyssuite#45. The maintainer
authorized adapting this publisher now and using `noarch: python`.

## How

The recipe declares one immutable noarch coordinate, preserves required metadata
constraints, uses host build tools and pip without dependency resolution. Thin
build/promotion wrappers reuse the common implementation at `a44e86a4f6a01dcbfe28fde46d886bc5cd4254c2`.
`devtools/conda-build/resources.toml` inventories the embedded version, package
roots and tracked runtime data. The example plan declares every supported source
CI job and its executed tests. A dedicated administrative reusable check inspects
the recipe/resources and publication controls without importing scientific code.

## Why

The old publisher used a moving action ref, interpreter/platform fan-out and
unrestricted manual public uploads. It did not retain the common exact-candidate
producer evidence. Its recipe did not declare noarch. The new route inspects the
exact built file before upload and promotes tested bytes without rebuilding.

## What is measured and what is assumed

Source inspection found pure Python code/data and no tracked bundled native
extension/executable. This migration is configuration and offline governance
work. It does not prove installed platform compatibility, scientific correctness,
credential access or public package availability. Full source CI remains unchanged;
internal direct/skip pushes remain available to dprada and LMMV.

## Alternatives and refuted paths

- A green recovery probe with skipped tests cannot authorize a candidate.
- Noarch does not prove macOS, Linux or Windows support.
- A second build/upload is not exact-file promotion.
- `release_plan.example.toml` does not authorize or select a public release.

## Scope and exclusions

Distribution governance and packaging identity/resources. Scientific algorithm
repairs and complete scientific execution belong to this component's team.

## Remaining adoption and acceptance criteria

- Review runtime environments/source routes against metadata with early negative
  dependency evidence and classify retained extra recipe requirements.
- Review each claimed public installation route without inferring it from config.
- Before a candidate, commit a reviewed actual release plan and immutable build.
- Implement the component-owned installed scientific gate and its exact-file
  `installed_gate` descriptor before promotion. Require every claimed cell and
  resource-use/launcher check; missing descriptor fails closed.
- Confirm publication access only through an authorized maintainer.
- Register actual candidate/build/installed/public evidence only after execution.

The migration implements the common source route; whole-policy adoption remains
partial until these criteria are met. The common policy and module's negative
guards are the durable reference; the owning issue remains open.

## Administrative verification, 2026-10-01

The common early recipe/resource check passes with the example plan; the common
publication-control audit and actionlint pass for all three local wrappers.
Local reporting/index validation passes. No scientific module was imported for
these checks.

An isolated copy was prepared with the common static-version helper and
`pip wheel --no-deps --no-build-isolation`. The illustrative version was 0.0.0;
no release candidate or publication was selected. The wheel is `py3-none-any`,
contains all 297 declared paths and the matching embedded version. This
checks setuptools packaging only; it does not certify a Conda artifact, public
PyPI availability, installed resource use or any scientific/platform claim.

Central common implementation a44e86a passed native governance run 36898671705
and 249 local administrative tests. Its archive guards separately reject missing
resources, stale embedded versions and native payloads before upload.

The retained extra runtime recipe requirement nglview needs owner classification; it was not silently removed.
