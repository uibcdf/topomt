## What is SMonitor

SMonitor is the diagnostics layer for the UIBCDF ecosystem. It centralizes warnings, errors, and developer signals so that user messages are consistent, actionable, and traceable across libraries.

SMonitor is not just a logging wrapper; it is a **Signal Orchestrator** that decouples event emission from message presentation.

## Why this matters in this library

- **Consistency**: Users see clear, helpful messages formatted as cards.
- **Traceability**: Developers can see the "Breadcrumb" trail across libraries.
- **AI-Ready**: Agents can parse structured events via the `agent` profile.

## Integration levels

Treat this guide in three layers:

1. **Mandatory**
   - required for a correct SMonitor integration in any sibling library.
2. **Recommended**
   - expected for modern QA/support readiness.
3. **Advanced / CI-support**
   - valuable once the mandatory and recommended layers are already in place.

If time is constrained, implement in that order.

## Minimum modern integration recipe

At minimum, a sibling library should have:

1. `_smonitor.py` plus private catalog/meta files.
2. `ensure_configured(PACKAGE_ROOT)` in package initialization.
3. catalog-driven emission via `DiagnosticBundle` / catalog exceptions and warnings.
4. `@signal` on public orchestration entry points.
5. `context_extra(...)` for repeated structured diagnostic fields.
6. the verification tests of section 7, plus one smoke test covering bundle export.

## 1. Required Configuration Structure

If the library package is named `mylib`, the following files must exist:

- `mylib/_smonitor.py`: Runtime configuration and message templates (CODES).

**Inside the package, not at the repository root.** Configuration discovery walks
*upward*, so a file at the repository root is found in a development checkout and
works there — and then is not packaged into the wheel, so it is simply absent for
everyone who installed your library. The failure is silent: diagnostics fall back
to defaults, every catalog code resolves against no template, and messages come
out empty. Every library in the ecosystem places it at `mylib/_smonitor.py`, and
`PACKAGE_ROOT` in `mylib/_private/smonitor/catalog.py` points at that directory.

Example `_smonitor.py`:
```python
PROFILE = "user"

SMONITOR = {
    "level": "WARNING",
    "trace_depth": 3,
    "capture_warnings": True,
    "capture_logging": True,
    "theme": "plain",
    "silence": ["pint", "networkx"],  # Noisy loggers to ignore
}
```
The `SMONITOR` block accepts the keyword arguments of `smonitor.configure(...)`;
`smonitor --validate-config` lists any it does not recognise. An unrecognised key
is reported and then ignored rather than raising, because this file is loaded
during your package's import and a typo must not take the library down —
`strict_config = True` turns those reports into an error when you want the
stricter behaviour.

- `mylib/_private/smonitor/catalog.py`: Catalog entries (meta-data about each signal).
- `mylib/_private/smonitor/meta.py`: Project metadata (URLs for documentation and issues).
- `mylib/_private/smonitor/__init__.py`: Exports `CATALOG`, `META`, and `PACKAGE_ROOT`.

### 1.1 Single Source of Truth for Templates

`CODES` and `SIGNALS` must be resolved from exactly one authoritative place.

Recommended pattern:
- define `CATALOG`, `CODES`, and `SIGNALS` in `mylib/_private/smonitor/catalog.py`;
- in `_smonitor.py`, import them from `mylib._private.smonitor.catalog`.

This avoids drift where emitted catalog codes exist but template messages are missing at runtime.

### 1.2 Profile fields, and what happens when one is missing

A `CODES` entry may carry a message and a hint per profile:

```python
CODES = {
    "MYLIB-W010": {
        "title": "Selection ambiguous",
        "user_message": "Selection '{selection}' is ambiguous.",
        "user_hint": "Use a more specific selector, for example '{example}'.",
        "dev_message": "Selection parser ambiguity on '{selection}'.",
        "dev_hint": "Review selector normalization.",
    }
}
```

Each profile reads its own field first — `user` reads `user_message`, `qa` reads
`qa_message`, and so on — and falls back through the nearest audience to the
`user_*` field when its own is absent. A generic `message` sits in the middle of
every message chain. **An entry that defines any message field renders in every
profile**; you are never required to write all four.

Write the variants that genuinely differ. MolSysMT writes all four for 49 codes
and only 2 of them repeat the same sentence, which is the feature working as
intended: the end user is told a probe did not succeed, the developer is given
the exception type and its message. Where one sentence serves every audience,
write it once.

Before `0.14.0` there was no fallback, and an entry defining `user_message`
alone rendered an **empty** message under `dev`, `qa`, `agent` and `debug`. If
your library targets an older SMonitor, keep writing every field you rely on.


## 2. Initialization Protocol

Level: **Mandatory**

In your library's `__init__.py`, ensure SMonitor is configured on import. This activates the "System Nervous System":

```python
from smonitor.integrations import ensure_configured
from ._private.smonitor import PACKAGE_ROOT

ensure_configured(PACKAGE_ROOT)
```

## 3. Emission via Catalog (Mandatory)

Level: **Mandatory**

All diagnostic output must be driven by the catalog. **Never hardcode strings** in the scientific logic.

### 3.1. Standard Warning Helper
Use the `DiagnosticBundle` to create consistent `warn` and `warn_once` helpers in your library's `_private/smonitor/emitter.py`:

```python
# mylib/_private/smonitor/emitter.py
from smonitor.integrations import DiagnosticBundle
from . import CATALOG, META, PACKAGE_ROOT

bundle = DiagnosticBundle(CATALOG, META, PACKAGE_ROOT)
warn = bundle.warn
warn_once = bundle.warn_once
resolve = bundle.resolve
```

### 3.2. Exceptions
All custom exceptions must inherit from `CatalogException` (provided by `smonitor.integrations`). This ensures messages are automatically hydrated from the catalog.

```python
# mylib/_private/smonitor/exceptions.py
from smonitor.integrations import CatalogException
from . import CATALOG, META


class MyLibException(CatalogException):
    def __init__(self, message=None, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(message, catalog=CATALOG, meta=META, **kwargs)


class ArgumentError(MyLibException):
    catalog_key = "ArgumentError"
    # ... logic to prepare extra dict ...
```

### 3.3. Warnings
Similarly, use `CatalogWarning` for warning classes:

```python
# mylib/_private/smonitor/warnings.py
from smonitor.integrations import CatalogWarning
from .emitter import bundle

class MyLibWarning(CatalogWarning):
    # ... setup catalog and meta ...
```

**Note**: The raw `emit_from_catalog` function is still available but `DiagnosticBundle` is the preferred high-level interface.

### 3.3.1 Pass structured data, not rendered sentences

A catalog template may interpolate its own placeholders. Pass typed fields in
`extra` and let SMonitor render them — do not pre-render the sentence and hand
it over as a string:

```python
# Correct: the template owns the wording, the call site owns the data.
# CODES["MYLIB-W010"]["user_message"] = "Atom name '{atom_name}' is not recognized."
warn(UnknownAtomNameWarning(atom_name=atom_name))

# Avoid: the template can only say "{message}", and the structured field
# never reaches report(), fingerprints, or resource counters.
warn(UnknownAtomNameWarning(message=f"Atom name '{atom_name}' ..."))
```

`warn(instance)` carries the instance's `extra` into the emitted event, so those
fields reach `report()`, `events_by_fingerprint`, and `most_noisy_resources` as
typed data. `{message}` remains available for string callers
(`warn("some text", MyWarning)`).

Catching code should read `exc.code` and `exc.extra` rather than parsing the
rendered English message.

#### Declare the message first, and the fields keyword-only

```python
class UnknownAtomNameWarning(CatalogWarning):
    catalog_key = "UnknownAtomNameWarning"

    def __init__(self, message=None, *, atom_name=None):
        super().__init__(message, catalog=CATALOG, extra={"atom_name": atom_name})
```

Python rebuilds a warning or exception as `type(w)(*w.args)`. `pickle` does it,
`copy.deepcopy` does it, `warnings.warn(text, category)` does it, and pytest-xdist
does it when a warning crosses from a worker to the controller. A class that
names a domain field first therefore receives *its own rendered sentence* as that
field, and the template renders around its own output:

```
Atom name 'Atom name 'Ar' is not recognized.' is not recognized.
```

Putting `message` first makes that rebuild land where it belongs. Keeping the
fields keyword-only preserves what a per-field signature is for: a misspelled
field stays a `TypeError` instead of becoming an extra nobody reads and a
template rendered with holes in it.

Where a class needs to *compute* its message, render it in a classmethod and
hand the finished text to `__init__`, so the constructor still stores what it is
given rather than deriving it:

```python
    @classmethod
    def for_atoms(cls, names):
        joined = ", ".join(sorted(names))
        rendered, _ = smonitor.resolve(code="MYLIB-W010", extra={"atom_name": joined})
        return cls(rendered, atom_name=joined)
```

One residue is not fixable this way: a hint whose template interpolates a field
cannot be re-rendered by a rebuilder that carries only `args`, since the field is
not there. That is a limitation of the transfer, not of the class, and it is
being addressed upstream in `pytest-dev/pytest-xdist#1372`.

### 3.3.2 `warn()` also raises an ordinary Python warning

Use `warn(...)` rather than `warnings.warn(...)`. It does both jobs: it emits the
structured, catalog-backed event **and** raises the warning through Python's
warning machinery, so everything your users and your test suite already rely on
keeps working:

```python
# Your users' filters apply as usual.
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=UnknownAtomNameWarning)
warnings.simplefilter("error")  # promotes it to an exception

# Your tests assert on it as usual.
with pytest.warns(UnknownAtomNameWarning, match="XXX"):
    get_atom_type_from_atom_name("XXX")
```

Calling `warnings.warn(MyCatalogWarning(...))` directly instead is the mistake
this replaces. The warning still reaches SMonitor when `capture_warnings` is on,
but only by way of the `py.warnings` logger, which delivers it as Python's
formatted text — file path and source line included — with `code=None`,
`source="py.warnings"`, no `category` and none of your structured fields. The
catalog entry is bypassed entirely, so the incident is invisible to
`events_by_code`, to fingerprint summaries and to any QA policy keyed on codes.

A filter that suppresses the warning for the user does **not** suppress the
SMonitor event: filters govern the console, not your telemetry. And when
`simplefilter("error")` promotes the warning to an exception, the event has
already been recorded before it is raised.

### 3.4 Emission Failures Must Not Be Silenced

Do not swallow diagnostics emission errors with `except Exception: pass`.

If emission fails in non-critical paths:
- fallback to a plain Python warning/log line;
- keep enough context (`caller`, signal key, exception text) for debugging.

Silencing emission failures causes loss of traceability and empty/noisy diagnostics in downstream libraries.

## 4. Telemetry with `@signal`

Level: **Recommended**

To enable execution traceability (breadcrumbs), decorate all major API entry points and internal orchestration functions.

```python
from smonitor import signal


@signal(tags=["topology"])
def get_atoms(molecular_system, selection="all"): ...
```

**Benefits**:
- On error, SMonitor reports the full call chain: `[mylib.api_func] -> [otherlib.internal_logic] -> [ERROR]`.
- Performance telemetry can be enabled globally without changing the code.

## 5. Signal Contracts

Level: **Recommended**

Enforce structured data by defining required fields in `_smonitor.py`:

```python
SIGNALS = {
    "mylib.select": {
        "extra_required": ["selection"],
    }
}
```

Missing fields will trigger warnings or errors in `dev` and `qa` profiles, ensuring diagnostic quality.

## 5.1 Structured Signal Context and Profiling

Level: **Recommended**

Recent pre-1.0 stabilization work added several profiling and machine-diagnostics capabilities that integrators should use deliberately:

- `@signal(..., extra_factory=...)` can attach structured per-call context without emitting a separate warning or error event.
- `report()` now exposes `timings_by_tag` in addition to timings by function and module.
- `slow_signal_ms` and `slow_signal_level` enable opt-in slow-call events (`SMONITOR-SIGNAL-SLOW`) for developer and QA workflows.

Recommended usage:

```python
from smonitor import signal


@signal(
    tags=["api", "selection"],
    extra_factory=lambda args, kwargs: {"selection": kwargs.get("selection")},
)
def get_atoms(molecular_system, selection="all"): ...
```

These features are intended for observability and QA; they should remain opt-in and must not flood end-user output by default.

## 5.2 Canonical Structured Context Helper

Level: **Recommended**

For library-generated diagnostics, prefer `smonitor.integrations.context_extra(...)` when building repeated `extra` payloads.

```python
from smonitor.integrations import context_extra, emit_from_catalog

emit_from_catalog(
    CATALOG["warnings"]["DownloadWarning"],
    extra=context_extra(
        caller="mylib.form.file_pdb.download",
        resource="181l.pdb",
        provider="RCSB",
        operation="download",
        extra={"attempt": 2, "retries": 5},
    ),
)
```

Use this helper for stable shared keys such as `caller`, `form`, `requested_attribute`, `resource`, `provider`, and `operation`.

Current canonical additive fields also include:
- retry metadata: `retry_attempt`, `retry_max`, `retry_exhausted`, `retry_delay_s`;
- causal metadata: `failure_class`, `last_failure_reason`, `cause_exception_type`, `cause_code`, `causal_chain`;
- decision metadata: `incident_kind`, `severity`, `priority`, `diagnostic_confidence`, `recommended_action`, `next_step`, `retryable`, `support_needed`;
- structured `evidence` for compact `expected`/`observed`/`resource`/`operation` facts.

Compact modern example:

```python
from smonitor.integrations import context_extra

extra = context_extra(
    caller="mylib.io.download_structure",
    resource="181l.pdb",
    provider="RCSB",
    operation="download",
    retry_attempt=2,
    retry_max=5,
    retry_exhausted=False,
    failure_class="network",
    last_failure_reason="timeout",
    incident_kind="network",
    recommended_action="retry",
    next_step="check-network",
    evidence={"expected": "download ok", "observed": "timeout"},
)
```

## 5.3 Report, Bundle, and Machine-Oriented Output

Level: **Advanced / CI-support**

SMonitor now exposes QA-oriented summaries beyond raw event streams:

- events carry stable `fingerprint`, `run_id`, `session_id`, and optional `correlation_id`.
- events also carry a stable additive `human_summary` block for concise human-facing handoff.
- `report()` includes `events_by_code`, `events_by_category`, `events_by_fingerprint`, `slow_signals_recent`, and `coalesced_warnings`.
- `report()` also exposes operational triage sections such as `top_codes`, `top_sources`, `top_fingerprints`, `most_noisy_resources`, `most_expensive_entries`, `blocking_incidents`, `actionable_incidents`, and `recurrent_incidents`.
- bundle exports mirror those summaries under `triage`.
- bundle exports also carry a `runtime` block and can be compared locally with `smonitor compare`.
- `JsonHandler` includes a `normalized` payload section with stable machine-oriented fields for cross-library ingestion, including retry/causal metadata, decision metadata, structured `evidence`, and mirrored `human_summary`.

These additions should be treated as the preferred source for automated QA summaries before scanning raw event buffers.

Minimal CI/support flow:

1. run tests or the representative workflow;
2. export a local bundle;
3. inspect `triage` first, not raw events;
4. compare against a previous bundle when asking “what changed?”;
5. only fall back to raw event streams when the summaries are insufficient.

## 5.4 Human-Readable Output and Coalescing

Level: **Advanced / CI-support**

Two usability rules now apply:

- Human-readable handlers may truncate very large structured payload fragments for `qa`, `dev`, and `debug` profiles. The underlying event payload is not altered.
- Repeated transient warnings can be coalesced with `warning_coalesce_window_s`. The first warning is emitted normally; suppressed duplicates are summarized in `coalesced_warnings`.

Use coalescing only for clearly repeated transient diagnostics such as download retries, not for semantically distinct warnings.

More general duplicate handling is also available through `duplicate_policy`, keyed by incident fingerprint. The current pre-1.0 supported policies are:
- `off`
- `emit_summary`
- `emit_every_n`

Use duplicate policies for genuinely repeated incidents where aggregate counts are more useful than verbatim repetition.

## 6. Noise Control

Level: **Recommended**

SMonitor captures all exceptions by default as `ERROR`. For functions that perform exploratory checks (e.g., "is this string a unit?"), this creates log noise.

### Exploratory Functions
Use `exception_level="DEBUG"` in the `@signal` decorator to silence expected failures in normal operation.

```python
@signal(tags=["check"], exception_level="DEBUG")
def is_valid_format(data):
    # If this raises, it will be logged as DEBUG, not ERROR
    ...
```

### Assertive Parsing
For functions that *must* succeed (e.g., "parse this unit"), keep the default `ERROR` level. If a user provides malformed input where a valid one is expected, it *is* an error.

## 7. Verify the integration

Level: **Mandatory**

An integration can be wired correctly and still be silently useless. The failure
modes below raise nothing, fail no test and print no warning — they only make
your diagnostics say less than they should, and they are found months later by a
user who reports "the error message was blank". Each check below is one
assertion, and each corresponds to a defect that reached a released library in
this ecosystem.

### Check 1 — the configuration is found and understood

```bash
smonitor --validate-config --config-path mylib
```

It prints the effective configuration and exits `0`, or names every key it does
not recognise and exits `2`, so it works as a CI gate as it stands.

Run it **against an installed wheel**, not only in your checkout. A `_smonitor.py`
outside the package is found in a checkout and is absent once installed, and that
difference is invisible from a development environment.

### Check 2 — every code you emit has a template

A catalog entry carries `code`, `source`, `category` and `level`; the wording
lives in `CODES`. A code present in one and absent from the other emits an event
with an empty message, and nothing complains.

### Check 3 — every code renders in every profile

A profile reads its own field and falls back to the others (section 1.2), so one
message field is enough. But a code whose entry defines *no* message field
renders empty everywhere, and a QA or agent session is exactly where nobody is
watching.

### Check 4 — catalog classes survive being rebuilt

Section 3.3.1 explains why. The guard is that rebuilding from `args` reproduces
`args`:

```python
type(exc)(*exc.args).args == exc.args
```

Test this and not only `pickle`: `pickle` restores the instance dictionary
afterwards, so it comes out correct **even for a class written the wrong way**.
It is the `args`-only rebuilders — `warnings.warn(text, category)` and
pytest-xdist between a worker and the controller — that expose the defect, and
`args` idempotence is what they test.

### One file that does all four

```python
# tests/test_smonitor_integration.py
import pickle

import pytest
import smonitor

from mylib._private.smonitor import CATALOG
from mylib._private.smonitor.catalog import CODES

PROFILES = ["user", "dev", "qa", "agent", "debug"]


def _catalog_codes(catalog):
    for group in ("exceptions", "warnings", "info"):
        for entry in (catalog.get(group) or {}).values():
            if isinstance(entry, dict) and entry.get("code"):
                yield entry["code"]


def test_every_catalog_code_has_a_template():
    orphans = sorted(set(_catalog_codes(CATALOG)) - set(CODES))
    assert not orphans, f"emitted with no template in CODES: {orphans}"


@pytest.mark.parametrize("profile", PROFILES)
def test_every_code_renders_in_every_profile(profile):
    smonitor.configure(profile=profile, handlers=[], codes=CODES)
    empty = [code for code in CODES if not smonitor.resolve(code=code, extra={})[0]]
    assert not empty, f"empty message under {profile!r}: {empty}"


@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "build",
    [
        # One builder per catalog class you define, in the shape a call site uses.
        lambda: UnknownAtomNameWarning("Atom name 'Ar' is not recognized.", atom_name="Ar"),
    ],
)
def test_catalog_classes_survive_a_rebuild(build):
    original = build()
    assert type(original)(*original.args).args == original.args
    assert str(pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(original))) == str(original)
```

Add the bundle smoke from the minimum recipe alongside it — `smonitor export`
followed by reading `triage` — and the integration is verified end to end.


## Required behavior (non-negotiable)

1.  **Zero String Hardcoding**: If it's a warning or error, it belongs in the catalog.
2.  **Lazy Diagnostics**: Do not perform expensive string formatting before calling `emit`. Pass raw data in `extra` and let SMonitor handle the interpolation.
3.  **Traceability First**: Use `@signal` generously in orchestration layers but avoid it in high-frequency tight loops.
4.  **Template Wiring Integrity**: Every emitted catalog code must have a matching template in the active `_smonitor.py` configuration. A code with no template emits an event whose message is the empty string — no exception, no warning, nothing in the logs. Check 3 of section 7 is the assertion that catches it.
5.  **No Silent Emission Failures**: Never hide failed catalog emissions without an explicit fallback diagnostic.
