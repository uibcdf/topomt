# Feature Hierarchy in TopoMT

```{important}
This page preserves an earlier taxonomy design. Its catalog and diagram do not
establish that every named detector or public feature is implemented. Use
[DFND: Theory and Method](../dfnd/index.md) and
[the public receiving study](../benchlab/synthetic/public_topography.md) for
current behavior and availability. Legacy feature dimensionality is a catalog
convention, distinct from the geometric dimension of recovered support.
```

```{admonition} Conceptual overview
:class: tip
The topographic entities in **TopoMT** are organized according to their **geometrical dimensionality** and **shape type**.  
Each *Feature* belongs to one of five canonical geometrical categories:

- `concavity` – inward or hollow regions (e.g., cavities, channels, voids).  
- `convexity` – outward or protruding regions (e.g., bumps, ridges).  
- `mixed` – transitional regions containing both concave and convex components.  
- `boundary` – edges or contours separating regions of different shapes.  
- `point` – zero-dimensional entities, used occasionally as markers or vertices.

Each *Feature* also has a `feature_type` describing its ontological role (e.g., pocket, mouth, ridge) and a unique `feature_id` identifying it within a `Topography` object.
```

## Canonical taxonomy

```{note}
The classes `Cavity` and `Vexity` are *canonical generic features*, not specific ones.  
They exist as entry points for unclassified concavities or convexities, and as root nodes of their respective families.
```

### 2D features — Surfaces

| Class | `shape_type` | Description |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Cavity** | `concavity` | Generic concave feature. Base class for `Pocket`, `Channel`, `Void`. |
| **Vexity** | `convexity` | Generic convex feature. Base class for `BaseRim`, `Ridge`. |
| **Interface** | `mixed` | Transitional surface between concave and convex regions. |
| **Boundary** | `boundary` | General border separating topographic regions. |

### 1D features — Edges

| Class | `shape_type` | Description |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Mouth** | `boundary` | Edge delimiting a concavity (e.g., pocket entrance). |
| **BaseRim** | `boundary` | Edge delimiting a convexity. |
| **Neck** | `boundary` | Narrow passage connecting two adjacent features. |
| **Ridge** | `boundary` | Line of maximal convexity, separating convex regions. |

*(In the future, 0D entities such as `Apex` or local critical points may be added.)*

## Integration into the documentation

You can place this file as a standalone page at:
```
docs/content/user_guide/feature_hierarchy.md
```

Then include it in your `toctree` under the *User Guide → Concepts* section.  
Alternatively, embed the UML block and tables in `docs/content/about/what_is_topomt.md` to provide an overview of the library's core entities.
